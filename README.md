# 🔐 Configuration Management (AWS Secrets Manager)

This application does not rely on local `.env` files for sensitive configuration in production.

All sensitive credentials and secrets are securely managed using **AWS Secrets Manager**.

### 🔒 Managed Secrets

The following configurations are retrieved securely from AWS Secrets Manager:

- Database Connection URI (MongoDB)
- JWT Access Token Secret
- JWT Refresh Token Secret
- AWS S3 Credentials
- Application-level sensitive keys

---

## 🛠 How It Works

- The application connects to AWS Secrets Manager during startup.
- Secrets are fetched dynamically using the AWS SDK.
- Values are injected into the configuration layer.
- No hardcoded secrets exist in the codebase.
- No sensitive credentials are stored in version control.

---

# 🐳 Docker Support

```bash
docker build -t royal-properties-backend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 royal-properties-backend
